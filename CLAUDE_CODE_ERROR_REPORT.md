# Claude Code CLI Error Report

**Report Generated:** 2025-07-10T18:23:44Z  
**Reporter:** Claude Flow Swarm Analysis  
**Issue Classification:** Critical - CLI Socket Communication Failure

## Executive Summary

Claude Code CLI experienced a socket communication error during IDE file operations, resulting in system crashes. The error originates from the CLI's internal socket handling mechanism, not from user application code.

## Error Details

### Primary Error Location
```
at Socket.<anonymous> (file:///usr/local/share/nvm/versions/node/v22.16.0/lib/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-code/cli.js:626:8977)
```

### Error Classification
- **Type:** Socket Communication Failure
- **Severity:** Critical (System Crash)
- **Component:** Claude Code CLI Core
- **Trigger:** IDE file operation interaction

### Reproduction Context
- **Action:** User opened `/workspaces/TicTacToe/bitwise-engine/src/DecisionEngine.cpp` in IDE
- **Result:** Claude Code CLI crash at socket handler
- **Frequency:** Reproducible during IDE file operations

## System Environment

### Software Versions
- **Claude Code CLI:** v1.0.48
- **Node.js:** v22.16.0
- **npm:** v11.4.2
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS
- **Architecture:** x86_64
- **Kernel:** Linux 6.8.0-1027-azure

### Runtime Environment
- **Platform:** GitHub Codespaces
- **Shell:** bash
- **Container:** Azure-based development environment

## Technical Analysis

### Socket Error Pattern
The error occurs in the Claude Code CLI's anonymous socket handler at line 626:8977 of `cli.js`. This suggests:

1. **WebSocket/IPC Communication Failure** between CLI and IDE
2. **Event Handler Exception** in socket message processing
3. **Resource Management Issue** during file operation coordination

### Impact Assessment
- **User Experience:** Complete CLI session termination
- **Data Integrity:** No user data loss (application code unaffected)
- **Workflow Disruption:** Requires CLI restart to continue work

### Root Cause Analysis
The crash appears to be triggered by:
1. IDE file opening operations
2. Socket communication between CLI and IDE integration
3. Possible race condition in event handling
4. Potential memory/resource cleanup issue

## Application Code Status

**IMPORTANT:** The user's TicTacToe application code is **NOT** the source of this issue.

### Verification Results
- ✅ C++ executables run successfully
- ✅ AI decision engine functions correctly  
- ✅ Game logic operates without crashes
- ✅ Memory management appears stable

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Restart Claude Code CLI** to restore functionality
2. **Clear CLI cache** if persistent issues occur
3. **Monitor socket connections** during IDE operations

### Development Team Actions
1. **Review socket handler** at `cli.js:626:8977`
2. **Implement better error handling** for socket exceptions
3. **Add logging** for socket communication events
4. **Test IDE integration** with various file types/sizes

### Debugging Enhancements
1. **Add try-catch blocks** around socket operations
2. **Implement graceful degradation** for socket failures
3. **Add connection state monitoring** 
4. **Improve error reporting** with context information

## Workarounds

### For Users
```bash
# Restart CLI session
exit
claude-code

# Clear cache if needed
rm -rf ~/.claude-code/cache 2>/dev/null
```

### For Development
- Monitor socket connection state before file operations
- Implement timeout handling for socket communications
- Add connection recovery mechanisms

## Additional Context

### Project Details
- **Project Type:** C++ TicTacToe with Bitwise Decision Engine
- **Complexity:** Advanced AI/Game Development
- **File Size:** Large C++ source files with complex logic
- **Development Stage:** Active development with frequent file access

### Error Frequency
- Occurs specifically during IDE file operations
- Not related to compilation or runtime execution
- CLI-specific infrastructure issue

## Attachments

### Relevant File Paths
- `/workspaces/TicTacToe/bitwise-engine/src/DecisionEngine.cpp` (trigger file)
- `/usr/local/share/nvm/versions/node/v22.16.0/lib/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-code/cli.js` (error source)

### System Logs
Error originates from Node.js Claude Code CLI, not application logs.
