# Bitwise Decision Engine
**Primary Objective**: Create a bitwise decision engine that emulates neural network behavior through efficient bitwise operations instead of traditional neural network mathematics.

**Proof of Concept**: TicTacToe game implementation to validate the engine's decision-making capabilities.

## Project Vision
This project aims to develop a computationally efficient alternative to traditional neural networks by using bitwise operations to achieve intelligent decision-making behavior. The TicTacToe game serves as our initial testing ground to prove the concept works in a real scenario.

### Key Goals
1. **Bitwise Decision Engine**: Build a functional decision-making system using bitwise operations
2. **Neural Network Emulation**: Achieve intelligent behavior similar to neural networks but with simpler, more efficient operations  
3. **Scalable Architecture**: Design the system to expand from TicTacToe to more complex decision-making scenarios
4. **Performance Efficiency**: Demonstrate computational advantages over traditional neural network approaches

### Optimization Philosophy
**Two-Phase Development Strategy:**

**Phase 1 - Maximum Efficiency:**
- Minimize memory footprint (optimized uint sizing, memory reuse)
- Maximize computational speed through bitwise operations
- Establish efficiency baseline and performance metrics

**Phase 2 - Precision Tuning:**
- Analyze efficiency/accuracy tradeoffs systematically
- Selectively trade speed/memory for accuracy gains
- Focus on cost-effective improvements (biggest accuracy gains for smallest efficiency cost)
- Make data-driven decisions about optimization retention

This approach ensures we first achieve peak possible efficiency, then intelligently trade resources for accuracy only where it provides the most value.

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
**Development Methodology**: Strict adherence to TDD principles throughout the project

**Objectives:**
1. **Code Quality Assessment**: Evaluate and improve existing TDD implementation
2. **Learning & Improvement**: Develop stronger TDD practices and methodologies
3. **Reliability**: Ensure robust, well-tested bitwise decision engine

**TDD Workflow:**
- Red: Write failing tests first
- Green: Implement minimal code to pass tests
- Refactor: Optimize while maintaining test coverage
- Repeat: Iterate through the cycle for all features

The existing Google Test framework in `bitwise-engine/test/` provides the foundation for comprehensive TDD implementation.

### Language Strategy
**Hybrid Approach**: Core engine in C++ with future Python accessibility

**Primary Development (C++):**
- Maximum memory control and computational efficiency
- Direct bitwise operations with minimal overhead
- Predictable performance characteristics
- Aligns with Phase 1 efficiency objectives

**Future Accessibility (Python Bindings):**
- Python bindings using pybind11 for AI community adoption
- Seamless integration with ML ecosystems
- Easier prototyping and experimentation
- Maintains core performance while expanding usability

This approach ensures we achieve peak efficiency in the core engine while keeping future accessibility options open.

## Project Structure
- **`bitwise-engine/`**: Core bitwise decision engine implementation (C++)
- **TicTacToe Game**: Testing platform and proof of concept for the engine
- **AI Swarm Development**: Using claude-flow for coordinated development across both components

## Development Approach
This project leverages AI swarm orchestration through claude-flow to coordinate development of both the bitwise engine and its TicTacToe implementation, ensuring seamless integration between the core engine and its practical application.
